      <h2 class="sub-heading">It's not happening yet, but the OpenAI CEO is 'not totally against' putting ads on ChatGPT.</h2>
      <p class="post-text">
        It was only a matter of time before OpenAI CEO Sam Altman addressed the inevitable: ads in ChatGPT. On the debut episode of OpenAIâ€™s official podcast, Altman was asked whether ads might show up in ChatGPT. He didnâ€™t dodge the topic.
        In fact, he sounded casually on board:
      </p>
      <p class="blockquote">
        "We haven't done any advertising product yet. I kind of...I mean, I'm not totally against it. I can point to areas where I like ads. I think ads on Instagram, kinda cool. I bought a bunch of stuff from them. But I am, like, I think
        it'd be very hard toâ€¦I mean, take a lot of care to get right."
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        The idea that Instagram ads are "cool" never gets a proper follow-up in the episode, but the real takeaway is that the door to advertising in ChatGPT is cracked open. OpenAI hasnâ€™t needed to rely on ads, largely thanks to
        unprecedented levels of venture capital. In March, the company raised $40 billion â€” the largest private tech funding round in history. That followed $6.6 billion from Microsoft and Nvidia in Oct. 2024. Just last week, OpenAI secured
        a $200 million contract with the US Department of Defense. The company needs that kind of capital. Keeping ChatGPT operational reportedly costs upwards of $3 to $4 billion a year. Operating at that scale means revenue models may
        eventually shift from experimental to inevitable. According to The Verge, ChatGPT has 20 million subscribers, and OpenAI projects $12.7 billion in revenue for 2025.
      </p>
      <p class="post-text">
        Altman isnâ€™t the first to consider advertising inside an AI chatbot. Google has been experimenting with native ads in Gemini. The concept has precedent, even if unofficial. This also isnâ€™t the first time ads have come up in the
        context of ChatGPT. In a 2024 discussion at Harvard Business School, Altman described advertising as a "last resort" for OpenAIâ€”a path he clearly wanted to avoid. By March of this year, that stance had softened. In an interview, he
        admitted, "Maybe thereâ€™s a tasteful way we can do ads, but I donâ€™t know." Just a few months later, Altmanâ€™s tone has shifted again. Heâ€™s more direct and open and clearly thinking through how ads could fit into ChatGPTâ€™s future.
        OpenAI hasnâ€™t provided any specifics yet, but the idea is on the table.
